# Executive summary
This project contains a number of tools for working with APIs provided by ProductPlan. ProductPlan is a tool for tracking roadmaps, releases, team and company OKRs, and customer enhancement requests.

This library has been built to fill in gaps with ProductPlan functionality, making it possible or easier to work with the product.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction:** Fetch ideas, teams, OKRs, and idea forms from ProductPlan
- **SLA Tracking:** Monitor response and roadmap decision timelines for customer ideas (NEW - November 2025)
- **Multiple Export Formats:** Excel, Markdown, and JavaScript
- **Docker-Based:** Simplified command interface with `make` commands
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 219 tests (100% passing)

Our latest in progress work is generally captured in plan.md (which is not part of the repo).
