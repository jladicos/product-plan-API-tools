Smoke tests for ProductPlan API Tools

These tests hit the real ProductPlan API to verify:
- API endpoints are still working
- Response structures haven't changed
- Authentication is working

These tests require a valid env/.env file with PRODUCTPLAN_API_TOKEN configured
and will be skipped if not present.
